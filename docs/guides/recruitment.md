# Grais Engineering Hiring Guide

> **Goal**: Find top-tier AI-focused engineers for two key roles.
> **Audience**: Co-founder/Recruiter to guide conversations.

## Introduction

We're seeking builders who believe AI can fundamentally reshape communication and are passionate about our mission: giving everyone an equal opportunity to communicate, be understood, and understand others. If you're someone who has a deep understanding of the AI landscape, leverages it daily in your work, and is ready to invest significant time into this mission, you might be who we're looking for.

**Please note:** These are not entry-level positions. We are looking for the top 1% of engineers – experienced individuals (mid-level to senior) capable of exceptional, high-impact work, taking full ownership, and driving projects forward autonomously. The early-stage nature of Grais demands significant dedication and a commitment that extends beyond a typical 9-to-5 schedule, reflecting the ambition of our mission and the scale of the opportunity.

Below is an overview of the technologies we use and the key roles we're hiring for.

## Tech Snapshot

Here's a high-level overview of the technologies we use. This should help you spot the right candidates.

- **Core Languages/Frameworks**: Python + FastAPI, (Go is a plus), OpenAI Agent SDK, LangChain, LangGraph
- **Frontend**: JSON-RPC WebSockets + React (real-time, generative UI)
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Docker, Postgres, message brokers, vector DBs
- **Models**: OpenAI, Google, Groq, DeepSeek
- **Daily Workflow**: Engineering AI Agents for communication and leverage highly configured AI tools (like Cursor) for rapid coding and iteration

### 1. Generalist Engineer (Agentic Systems)

- **Role Focus**: Design, build, and refine "AI agents" that handle tasks, talk to various services, and manage real-time data, taking ownership from initial concept through to production release.
- **Primary Skills**: Strong Python (Go +), comfortable with distributed systems, orchestration, and multi-agent / tool coordination.
- **Traits**: Moves quickly, iterates often, and thrives on figuring out how different parts of the stack talk to each other. Capable of driving features through the full development lifecycle in tight cycles. They're at the forefront of leveraging AI in their own workflow—using tools like advanced AI editors to boost productivity.
- **Why It Matters**: As we chase a massive market opportunity in AI-driven communication, this person keeps our agentic infrastructure robust, scalable, and ready for rapid growth.
