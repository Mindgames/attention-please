# Linear Project Management Best Practices

## Core Principles

### Single Ownership and Accountability

- Assign one directly responsible individual (DRI) as the Project Owner
- The owner is accountable for driving the project to completion
- The owner is responsible for writing and updating the project description

### Outcome over Output

- Define success in measurable terms
- Focus on business impact rather than just deliverables
- Distinguish between completion-based goals (output) and target-based goals (outcome)
- Example: "Launch the new mobile app by Q2" (output) vs. "Achieve 1,000 daily active users by Q3" (outcome)

### Brevity and Clarity

- Keep project descriptions lean and focused
- Aim to communicate the essence in a few paragraphs or bullet points
- Include the fundamental "why", "what", and "how" at a high level
- Ensure descriptions are understandable by any team member

### Defined Scope and Deliverables

- Clearly outline what's in and out of scope
- List key deliverables or features to be completed
- Define project boundaries to prevent scope creep
- Ensure each task ladders up to the defined scope

### Short Iterations & Milestones

- Break projects into smaller, time-bounded iterations
- Aim for completion in a few weeks by a small team
- Force prioritization of the most important features first
- Create quick feedback loops with customers
- Establish clear definition of "done" with end dates

### Alignment with Company Objectives

- Link each project to a higher-level goal or OKR
- Include a brief note on why the project matters to company goals
- Maintain line-of-sight between daily work and strategic objectives
- Ensure teams can answer "How does this project move the needle for us?"

### Transparency and Tooling

- Use Linear to make project information accessible to all team members
- Centralize key details in the project tracking tool
- Attach relevant resources (design links, research docs, Slack channels)
- Regularly update project status for team visibility
- Leverage automation and integrations for streamlined communication

### Regular Check-ins and Updates

- Institute lightweight check-ins (weekly sync or async updates)
- Note progress, risks, blockers, and scope changes
- Keep the project description as a living document
- Update the brief whenever something significant changes

## Implementing in Linear

### Creating Projects

- Use Linear's "+ Project" functionality
- Fill in the properties (Lead, Members, Target Date)
- Copy the template sections into the project's Description area
- Format with rich text editing (bold headings, bullet points)

### Linking Tasks

- Associate individual tasks (issues) with the project
- Outline key tasks in the project description
- Create corresponding Linear issues for each
- Embed issues in the description for easy reference

### Tracking Progress

- Monitor the automatic progress indicator (X% of issues completed)
- Keep task statuses updated
- Use Linear's roadmap view to reflect status, owner, and target date
- Set up notifications for key project events

### Keeping Everything in One Place

- Avoid managing parts of the project in separate tools
- Attach design files, notes, and relevant artifacts
- Leverage Linear's project attachments and links

## Scaling Best Practices

### Consistency Across Teams

- Use the same project template format across different teams
- Create a common language for cross-functional collaboration
- Reduce the learning curve for new team members

### Adapting Detail to Complexity

- Keep core fields the same as projects grow in scope
- Increase level of detail as needed for larger projects
- Consider adding RACI charts for projects with many contributors

### Tool Support for Scale

- Use team features in Linear to separate concerns
- Maintain common template structure across teams
- Balance standardization with flexibility

### Regular Retrospectives

- Periodically review and improve the template
- Gather feedback on what's working and what's not
- Make it a living template that evolves with your organization

### Maintaining Accountability

- Reinforce the practice of single ownership
- Empower project owners to take charge
- Create clear escalation paths and speed up decision-making

## Template Sections Explained

### Project Title

- Keep it succinct but specific
- Include a noun and verb or outcome
- Make it easy to reference in meetings and updates

### Owner & Contributors

- List the full name and role of the project lead
- Specify key team members or teams contributing
- Clarify roles and responsibilities

### Background & Rationale

- Explain the problem or opportunity being addressed
- Provide context for why the project is needed now
- Connect to broader company goals or OKRs

### Goals & Objectives

- State the primary goal clearly
- Distinguish between output (deliverables) and outcome (metrics)
- Make goals specific and measurable

### Scope & Deliverables

- Outline key components to be delivered
- Provide high-level breakdown of the project
- Specify what's out of scope if helpful

### Timeline & Milestones

- Set target start and end dates
- Identify key checkpoints or milestones
- Note external deadlines or events if relevant

### Risks & Dependencies

- List known blockers or risk factors
- Note external dependencies
- Acknowledge assumptions
- Outline contingency plans

### Status & Updates

- Keep status visible and current
- Log key updates throughout the project lifecycle
- Maintain transparency about progress and challenges
