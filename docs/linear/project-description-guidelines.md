### 2. Objectives & Success Criteria

- **Primary Objective**: The main goal of the project
- **Key Results**: 3-5 measurable outcomes that define success
- **Success Metrics**: Quantifiable indicators that will be tracked

### 3. Scope Definition

- **In-Scope**: Clearly define what work is included
- **Out-of-Scope**: Explicitly state what is not included
- **Dependencies**: List any projects, teams, or systems this project depends on

### 4. Timeline & Milestones

- **Target Start/End Dates**: When the project begins and ends
- **Key Milestones**: Critical checkpoints throughout the project
- **Phases**: Breakdown of the project into logical segments

### 5. Resources & Stakeholders

- **Team Members**: Who will work on the project and their roles
- **Stakeholders**: Who has interest in or influence over the project
- **Budget/Resource Allocation**: Resources dedicated to the project

### 6. Risks & Mitigation Strategies

- **Identified Risks**: Potential threats to project success
- **Mitigation Plans**: Strategies to address each risk
- **Contingency Plans**: Backup approaches if primary strategies fail

### 7. Communication Plan

- **Status Update Frequency**: How often updates will be provided

Remember that a well-structured project description serves as the north star for the team throughout the project lifecycle.
