# Grais: Strategic Communication Augmentation

This document outlines how Grais's AI helps overcome traditional communication challenges across critical domains while keeping humans at the center of every interaction.

## Human-in-the-Loop Philosophy

Grais is designed as an augmentation tool, not an automation tool. The human remains the decision-maker, with Grais providing critical context, suggestions, and strategic insights that would otherwise be missed. Some key principles:

- **You Decide**: Grais never sends messages without human review and approval
- **You Control**: All suggestions can be modified, rejected, or accepted
- **You Benefit**: The system learns from your choices to provide better support over time
- **You Lead**: Grais enhances your communication abilities without replacing your voice
