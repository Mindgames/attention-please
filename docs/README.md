# Grais Documentation

Welcome to the central documentation hub for Grais. This repository contains information on our vision, technical architecture, project details, roadmap, guides, and processes.

**Core Philosophy:** Grais operates on a principle of **AI Augmentation**, where our technology enhances human communication capabilities rather than replacing them. The human remains central to all interactions, benefiting from AI-driven insights and suggestions while retaining full control. See the [Human-in-the-Loop Philosophy](vision/human-in-the-loop.md) for details.
