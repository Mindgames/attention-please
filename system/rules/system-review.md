# SYSTEM-REVIEW Routine

> **Limitation:** This routine must process no more than 20 documents per run. If more exist, prioritize the most critical or recently updated ones.

## Purpose

Automate a comprehensive review of all system documentation, summarizing the current state, identifying gaps or inconsistencies, and suggesting actionable improvements.

## Steps

1. **Collect Documentation**

   - Read all key documents in the system, including:
     - Vision, philosophy, and usage scenarios
     - Technical architecture and upgrade rationale
     - Project plans and roadmaps
     - Best practices, guides, and process docs
     - Any agentic system rules or routines

2. **Summarize the System**

   - For each document, provide a concise summary of its purpose and main points.
   - Note any missing, outdated, or unclear sections.

3. **Analyze for Gaps and Inconsistencies**

   - Identify inconsistencies in terminology, philosophy, or technical details.
   - Detect missing links, outdated references, or incomplete documentation.

4. **Suggest Improvements**

   - Propose at least three concrete, actionable improvements to the documentation or system design.
   - For each suggestion, provide a brief rationale.

5. **Output a Structured Report**
   - Present the review as a structured report, with sections for summaries, issues found, and recommendations.

## Output Format

- **Section Summaries**
