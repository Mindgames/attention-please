# Private Ops

## Summary

Personal admin work (travel, health, finance) tracked separately so deadlines don't slip and distract from core projects.

## Value & Purpose

- Primary value: reduce mental load and deadline risk
- Why now: near-term travel and healthcare tasks are pending
- Success looks like: urgent personal tasks completed on time with clear next steps

## Scope

- In-scope: travel booking, healthcare admin, personal finance actions
- Out-of-scope / Guardrails: business operations or product work
- Dependencies: airlines, banks, healthcare providers

## Current Milestone

- **Name**: Clear urgent personal admin
- **Target**: TBD
- **Definition of Done**: Flight booked; dentist step 1 savings set aside

## Top Tasks (next up)

- [x] Move money for Warsaw flight :: impact=H; effort=0.25h; due=2025-12-29; owner=@mathias
- [x] Book flight to Warsaw (Tue/Wed) :: impact=H; effort=0.5h; due=2025-12-29; owner=@mathias; notes=after funds are ready
- [ ] Set aside EUR 2k for dentist step 1 (upper teeth replacement) :: impact=M; effort=0.25h; due=unset; owner=@mathias
- [ ] Plan/save EUR 7k for veneers (next stage) :: impact=L; effort=0.5h; due=unset; owner=@mathias

## Plan (next 7 days)

- Move money for the flight, then book Warsaw for Tue/Wed.
- Set aside the 2k for dentist step 1.
- Draft a simple savings plan for the 7k veneers stage.

## Recent Activity (last 7 days)

- 2026-01-22 - Warsaw flight booked; funds moved.
- 2025-12-28 - Plan to book Warsaw flight tomorrow after funds are ready.

## Risks / Blocks

## Ops & Reflection Log (agent-written)

> One entry per action. First line = facts, second line = evaluation. Keep it terse.

**Entry format**
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmZ - RUN - - link:<url or -> - result: success|partial|fail - time:<Xm|Xh> - impact:H|M|L
EVAL - value:+|=|- - why:<1 sentence> - risk:low|med|high - confidence:<0.0-1.0> - next:<1 concrete step or ->

**Example**
2025-12-26T10:00Z - RUN - - link:<url or -> - result: success - time:1h - impact:H
EVAL - value:+ - why:<1 sentence> - risk:low - confidence:0.9 - next:<1 concrete step or ->

**Daily Review**

- Summarize the day's work
- Reflect on the results
- Plan the next day's work
- Update the project status, tasks, plan, risks, etc.

<!--
AGENT NOTES (keep this comment):
- On every write, update front-matter `updated:`.
- Top Tasks: compute ICE = Impact x Confidence / Effort(hours); append `priority=ICE:x.x` if helpful; keep only 3-7 tasks here.
- If a RUN result is "fail" or "partial", add/adjust a task in Top Tasks and reference it in `next:`.
- When kill_criteria is met or due will slip, add a Risk and a Decision Log entry, and surface in the next Review.
- Keep Recent Activity to last 5 lines; move older entries into a sidecar LOG.md if needed (same folder).
