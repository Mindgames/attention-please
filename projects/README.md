# Projects Index

Each project lives in its own folder under `projects/` and includes a `PROJECT.md` with scope, milestones, and tasks. Use `projects/PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md` to start a new project.

Program structure: For multi-part programs, add a parent folder with a program-level `PROJECT.md`, and place subprojects as subfolders (each with its own `PROJECT.md`).
