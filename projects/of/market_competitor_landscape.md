# Market & Competitor Landscape (2025-08-19)

- Incumbent agencies: 20–50% rev‑share (30–40% common). Strength: traffic & upsell. Weakness: headcount heavy.
- Automation vendors: SpicyAI, ChatPersona, Whisper… tiered pricing; moat = data + integrations; ToS friction.
- Grey‑market shops: $2–$5/h + 1–3% commission; weak QA/compliance.
- Moats for us: persona & memory packs; guardrails; whale detection + human closers.
- Platform/legal: automation in chat prohibited by OF ToS; strict age/consent/KYC; maintain privacy and audit logs.
