[22:56] user: hello
[22:56] assistant: Quick Plan
- Aim for a scrappy V1 in the 12:30 block: Problem, Approach, Impact, Next Steps (900–1200 words).
- Reduce friction: open the doc, pull refs, enable DND, prep two 25‑min timers.
Next Step
- Write success criteria + a skeleton outline at the top of the doc, then draft in two sprints.
Quick Qs: Ready to start the 12:30 block? Do you have the latest requirements/notes link?
[23:23] user: Hm, i need to work efficently
[23:23] assistant: Next Step
- Lock in your start time and first deep‑work block; mornings go to the proposal.
- Write 3 outcomes that make tomorrow a win (V1 progress, not perfection).
- Prep your environment now: DND preset, 25‑min timer template, proposal doc opened to headings.
- Once I have your start time and constraints, I’ll draft a lean schedule for tomorrow.
