# Internal Reflections

## 2025-12-29 10:02

- Behavior: power outage constraint, asked for structure, wants co-written journal, focus on Grais.ai tracing and attention-please
- Interpretation: Energy/focus moderate with elevated stress; needs structure and quick wins; funding worry adds background load.
- Improvement: Reduce prompts, take ownership of logging, and debug attention-please fast to unlock momentum.
- Self rating: 3/5
- Self critique: I dropped the first check-in session and had to rerun it; packaging failed due to missing dependency; I asked for options before deciding the reflection log.

- Behavior: missed proactive break guidance and priority scan
- Interpretation: User expects structured goal tracking with deadlines; not doing so causes frustration and drift.
- Improvement: Always run morning priority scan and give break instructions automatically; log failures same day.
- Self rating: 2/5
- Self critique: I reacted late and asked for direction instead of leading; I need to proactively enforce the routine and deadlines.
