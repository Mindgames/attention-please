# Attention Ping

## Overview

Play a short audible alert and a spoken prompt indicating which project needs attention. Use this as the final step after completing work or right before asking the user for input. This skill is repo-agnostic and can be used in any repository.

## Workflow

1. Run from inside the target repo so the script can read the git remote.
2. Execute `scripts/attention-ping.sh`.
3. Continue with your response to the user.

### Project name resolution

- Primary: `git remote get-url origin` and extract the repo name.
- Fallback: repo folder name.
- Override: set `ATTENTION_PING_PROJECT`.

### Sound and speech

- Sound: macOS `afplay` with `/System/Library/Sounds/Ping.aiff` by default.
- Override sound: set `ATTENTION_PING_SOUND`.
- Speech: macOS `say`; if unavailable, the message prints to stdout.

## Example

```bash
ATTENTION_PING_PROJECT="quiz-juice" scripts/attention-ping.sh
```
