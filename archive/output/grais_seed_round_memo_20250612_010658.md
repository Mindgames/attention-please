1. Executive Summary
See above.

2. Investment Highlights
• First-mover cross-platform “Conversation Graph” memory layer with patent-pending IP and 3× faster latency than Copilot.
• Strong early validation: 14 LOIs (>US$1.8 M ARR), 6,600 wait-list sign-ups, 1,200 GitHub stars, 32 % D30 retention across 150 beta users.
• Seasoned founder/CTO/CPO trio with prior AI exit, big-tech backgrounds and advisor bench from DeepMind, HubSpot, Stripe.
• Attractive SaaS unit economics: projected LTV/CAC >19×, gross margin 78–80 %, churn <3 %.
• Pricing advantage (PRO US$9–12 vs MS Copilot US$30) and distribution via browser extension yields low CAC (<US$25).
• Platform partnerships (Nvidia, Google, WhatsApp, LinkedIn) de-risk infrastructure, GTM channels and regulatory compliance.
• Clear 18-month roadmap to Series-A metrics: ≥10 k DAU, >US$1 M ARR, SOC-2 Type II, 50 enterprise pilots.

3. Market Opportunity & Problem Statement
• TAM: US$29 B conversational-AI market today, forecast >US$70 B by 2030 (23.7 % CAGR).
• SAM: US$4.2 B across 35 M SMB knowledge-worker seats in EU & NA.
• Pain: knowledge workers juggle 3–7 communication platforms; lack persistent memory causes costly misalignment, lost deals, delayed decisions.
• Existing tools (Copilot, Grammarly, Slack AI) are single-ecosystem or grammar-centric, not cross-platform or deep-context.

4. Solution & Product Vision
• Browser extension (Chrome, Edge, Safari) + cloud Agentic System v2.0 ingest on-screen messages, build Conversation Graph, surface context cues, generate strategic suggestions while user retains control.
• Human-in-the-Loop philosophy guarantees authenticity, accountability and regulatory friendliness.
• Roadmap: multi-agent playbooks, predictive outcome coaching, enterprise dashboards, voice/AR channels.

5. Competitive Advantage & Technology
• Patent-pending Context-Adaptive Memory Eviction Algorithm and Conversation Graph trademark.
• Multi-LLM router (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) reduces vendor lock-in and cost volatility.
• Horizontally sharded pgvector store designed for 10k QPS; P95 latency 1.2 s.
• UI-layer injection enables platform agnosticism that incumbents cannot replicate without violating privacy policies.
• Data moat: opt-in labelled cross-platform dialogue + viral “Sent with Grais” signature.

6. Business Model & Path to Revenue
• Freemium (100 prompt/mo) → PRO (US$9/mo individual) → Teams (US$16/seat) → Enterprise (US$40–200/seat, SSO, SOC-2, analytics) plus Data-Insights API (2027, 85 % GM).
• Conversion assumed 0.5 %→1.2 %; NRR 120 %; churn <3 %.

7. Financial Projections & Unit Economics (Mgmt Case)
2025E: US$0.2 M rev / (77 % GM) / burn US$2 M
2026E: US$3.2 M rev / (78 % GM) / burn US$1.5 M
2027E: US$12.4 M rev / 80 % GM / breakeven Q4-27
LTV/CAC: PRO 21.6×, Teams 19.2×, Enterprise 24×
Cash required to breakeven: <US$5 M.

8. Founding Team & Execution Track Record
• CEO – Mathias R., ex-Founder NewNative.ai (acq. 2022), Forbes 30U30, scaled to 4 M ARR bootstrapped.
• CTO – ex-Stripe infra lead; built 100k TPS distributed systems.
• CPO – ex-Grammarly PM owning 50 M MAU editor; led launch of Tone Detector.
• Advisors – DeepMind (AI ethics), HubSpot (PLG), Stripe (Finance & Risk).
• Achievements: Best EU AI Startup 2023, Nvidia Inception & Google Support Fund grants, P95 latency record 1.2 s.

9. Go-to-Market Strategy & Early Traction
Phase 1 (now–Q2 26): PLG browser extension, viral footer, community OSS repo (already 1,200 stars).
Phase 2 (Q3 25): Platform partnerships—WhatsApp ISV, LinkedIn Partner Network, Telegram.
Phase 3 (2026): Enterprise sales & channel partners, land-and-expand motion.
KPIs today: 150 beta users (32 % D30), 6.6 k wait-list, 14 signed LOIs across SaaS, legal, healthcare.

10. Use of Funds & Milestones to Series A (18 mos)
• 50 % Engineering – ship Agentic System v2.0, mobile + desktop clients, SOC-2.
• 30 % GTM – growth hires, community, self-serve funnel, pilot onboarding.
• 10 % Compliance – GDPR, EU-AI Act ‘limited-risk’, patent filings.
• 10 % Working capital & runway buffer.
Milestones: >10 k DAU, ≥US$1 M ARR, 100 enterprise pilots, churn <3 %, SOC-2 Type II, 75 %+ GM.

11. Risk Factors & Mitigation
• Big-Tech fast-follow: mitigate via cross-platform memory moat, speed, low price, patent filings.
• LLM cost inflation: multi-LLM router, 20 % annual cost decline assumption, in-house fine-tunes.
• Platform lockouts: formal partnerships (WhatsApp, LinkedIn), UI-layer approach, privacy-by-design.
• Regulatory shifts: early EU AI Act alignment, advisor from DeepMind ethics.
• Adoption/retention: PLG funnel test currently shows 32 % D30; plan cohort-based onboarding & enterprise CSM.

12. Investment Terms & Conclusion
• Ask: US$3–5 M Seed Preferred at US$12–18 M post-money; 1× non-participating liquidation pref; standard Seed rights.
• Use of proceeds: extend runway 18 months to Series A at ≥US$5 M ARR.
• Exit paths: strategic acquisition by Microsoft, LinkedIn, Salesforce, Slack/Atlassian, or standalone Series B/IPO.

Recommendation: Proceed to term-sheet subject to patent and cohort-retention DD; Grais offers a rare chance to own the category-defining cross-platform AI communication layer at the Seed stage.
