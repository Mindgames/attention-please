• Seed raise calibrated to reach Series A milestones (GA, USD 1 M ARR, 10 K DAU) on <USD 5 M burn.

3. Market Opportunity & Problem Statement
Knowledge workers juggle 3–7 messaging platforms daily, losing context and clarity. U.S. firms alone forfeit an estimated USD 1.2 T/year to mis-communication. Conversational-AI spend is USD 29 B today, growing at 23.7 % CAGR to USD 70 B by 2030. Grais initially targets North America & EMEA SMBs (SAM USD 4.2 B) with an attainable SOM of 60 K paid users generating USD 12.4 M ARR by 2027.

4. Solution & Product Vision
Grais is a browser-level and mobile “conversation OS” that injects AI agents into any chat UI. Features include:
• Persistent cross-thread memory and retrieval-augmented generation.
• Real-time, context-aware suggestions the user approves (human-in-the-loop).
• Multi-agent playbooks for sales, recruiting, support, networking, personal follow-ups.
Roadmap phases: Chrome extension → computer-vision universal client → deep personalization → mobile/voice → predictive conversation modeling.

5. Competitive Advantage & Technology
• Technology moat: patent-pending memory algorithm, horizontally-sharded vector store (10 K QPS, P95 1.2 s), multi-LLM routing.
• Platform-agnostic UI-injection avoids API lock-in faced by Copilot, Slack AI.
• Data moat compounds as users allow opt-in cross-platform logs.
• Pricing advantage: USD 12/seat vs. Copilot USD 30 and Jasper USD 49.
