# Agentic system 1.0

**Owner:** [Project Owner] (Engineering Lead)

**Contributors:** Engineering Team, Product Team

## Background & Rationale

As we evolve our AI capabilities, building an agentic system will allow Grais to generate more intelligent and contextually rich _suggestions_. By coordinating information gathering between different sources and contexts, this system enhances the speed and quality of AI-driven suggestions presented to the user. Crucially, this system operates strictly within our core philosophy of **Human-in-the-Loop** and **AI Augmentation**, ensuring the user _always_ remains in control of final decisions and communications.

**Company Alignment:** Supports our Q2 goal to enhance AI capabilities by providing more sophisticated _suggestion generation_, ultimately leading to more powerful human augmentation.

## Goals & Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Design and implement a comprehensive agentic system capable of orchestrating _information gathering and suggestion generation_ across multiple sources and contexts to better support the human user.

**Key Results:**

- Complete system design by mid-Q2
- Implement working prototype by end of Q2
- Support at least 3 critical data sources for suggestion enrichment

**Success Metrics:**

- System successfully coordinates information between different agents to enrich suggestion quality
- Quality of generated _suggestions_ improves by 30% in automated tests (measuring relevance, contextuality)
- System efficiently generates suggestions for 95% of relevant use cases, requiring minimal pre-processing _before presenting options for final human review and action_.

## Scope

**In-Scope:**

- Design of all system components (agents, interfaces, communication, coordination, control, memory, feedback)
- Implementation of system components
- Support for key data sources and formats

**Out-of-Scope:**

- Integration with non-critical third-party services
- Advanced natural language generation beyond current capabilities
- End-user dashboard for agent management

**Dependencies:**

- Access to current AI models
- Infrastructure for distributed computing
- Evaluation framework for testing agent performance

## Timeline

**Start Date:** Beginning of Q2
**End Date:** End of Q2

**Milestones:**

- System architecture design - Week 3
- Initial agent implementation - Week 6
- Integration testing - Week 10
- Production deployment - End of Q2

## Risks & Mitigation

**Known Risks:**

- Complexity of agent coordination for information gathering: Start with simplified test cases.
- Performance bottlenecks in suggestion generation pipeline: Implement monitoring from day one.
- Security concerns with complex agent coordination and data access: Regular security reviews; enforce strict data access policies.

**Contingency Plans:**

- Phased rollout with careful monitoring of suggestion quality.
- Ability to fall back to simpler suggestion generation methods if issues arise.
- **Mitigation:** Strict adherence to Human-in-the-Loop model; agents _never_ take final actions or send communications, only propose suggestions for human review.
