## 1. Investment Highlights

- **Greenfield Category** — No incumbent owns a universal, cross-platform conversation memory layer. Grais.ai is positioned to become the operating system for human-to-human messaging.

- **Huge, Fast-Growing Market** — Conversational-AI spend forecast to reach USD 41B by 2030 (23.7% CAGR), fueled by hybrid work and Gen-AI adoption.

- **Patent-Pending Technology** — Context-Adaptive Memory Eviction Algorithm delivers persistent recall with sub-second latency—unmatched by writing assistants or chatbots.

- **Self-Reinforcing Data Moat** — Opt-in architecture accumulates proprietary labelled dialogue at acquisition—compounding accuracy and defensibility every day.

- **Capital-Efficient Model** — Cloud-native stack, declining token costs and PLG acquisition support gross-margin trajectory > 75% at scale.

- **Founders with Proven Execution** — Same team that won Europe's Best AI Startup 2023; supported by Nvidia Inception & Google Support Fund.

- **Clear Seed-to-Series A Milestones** — GA launch, ≥10K DAU and ≥USD 1M ARR targeted inside 18 months with < USD 5M burn.

## 2. Market Opportunity

**Macro Tailwinds:** Knowledge workers juggle 3–7 chat channels daily; miscommunication costs U.S. firms USD 1.2T/y (IDC 2024).

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):** 35M SMB/scale-up users in EMEA & NA represent USD 4.2B annual revenue potential at $10–$15/seat.

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):** 250M global knowledge workers → USD 29B+ annually.

**Expansion Paths:** Vertical agents (Legal, Sales, Healthcare) + anonymised conversation-insight API grow TAM to USD 70B over the decade.
