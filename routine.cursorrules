# Daily Logging Routine Instructions

This rule complements the `daily_procedures.todo_check` outlined in the main `.cursorrules`.

## Objective
Maintain a concise yet informative daily log (`daily_log.md`) to track actions, decisions, and progress without creating excessive noise.

## Procedure
1.  **Initialization:** At the beginning of a new interaction or work session for the day:
    *   Reference the `daily_log.md` file.
    *   Verify if an entry for the current date already exists. If not, create one (e.g., `## YYYY-MM-DD`).
    *   Note the initial `TODO.md` check as per the main `.cursorrules`.

2.  **Action Logging:** Throughout the session, log *significant* actions, decisions, or completed milestones. Focus on *what* was achieved or decided, not every minor step.
    *   **Conciseness is key.** Use brief bullet points.
    *   Examples:
        *   `Formatted market-report.md.`
        *   `Created routine.cursorrules.`
        *   `Discussed refactoring approach for module X.`
        *   `Resolved blocker related to API key.`

3.  **Efficiency:** The goal is tracking, not exhaustive documentation. The log should provide a quick overview of the day's key activities. Avoid lengthy descriptions or pasting large code blocks.

4.  **Review:** Briefly review the log at the end of a session or day to ensure key events are captured.
