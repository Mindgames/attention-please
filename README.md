# Grais.ai – Investment Memorandum (Draft)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Grais.ai is building the **first context-persistent AI communication layer** that lives inside everyday channels (WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Telegram, browser) to eliminate costly miscommunication and decision delay.

- **Problem:** Digital miscommunication costs U.S. enterprises ~USD 1.2 trillion annually (IDC, 2024).
- **Solution:** OpenAI-powered agents + proprietary memory graph save users ≈26 minutes/day.
- **Market:** Conversational AI TAM projected to reach **USD 41.4 billion by 2030** at **23.7% CAGR**.
- **Moat:** Cross-platform injection + compounding memory dataset.
- **Ask:** **[US $X million] Series A** at **[pre-money valuation]**, 24-month runway.

**To do:**
- [ ] Plug in time-savings metrics (pilot/user data).
- [ ] Finalize raise size and valuation.
- [ ] Compare with productivity benchmarks from Grammarly, Copilot, etc.

---

## 2. The Problem

- Workers are overwhelmed by fragmented, low-context messages.
- Miscommunication costs ~$12,500/employee/year.
- Tools like Grammarly fix grammar, but don’t track context across conversations/platforms.

**To do:**
- [ ] Collect case studies or data showing ROI loss due to miscommunication.
- [ ] User quotes or pain points from discovery interviews.
- [ ] Define the most affected verticals (e.g., remote teams, customer support, sales).
